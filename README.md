you would like to run your alexa skills.

# ALEXA SKILL SETUP:

Register as an amazon developer on developer.amazon.com. On the developer.amazon.com page, click "Skills" and "Add New Skill".
In this repository each skill is contained within a seperate folder which will have its own README file containing the Intent
Schema and Sample Utterances. After specifying the title and invocation name (The statement which will activate the skill,
preferablly the title or a shortened version of the title), copy and paste the Intent Schema and Sample Utterances to their
respective boxes. If there is a custom slot in the README, create that by putting in the specified name and pasting in the
slot list.

For the configuration, any service can be used which will forward traffic from the given url to the localhost. We reccomend
using ngrok. Here is a link to ngrok, its installation and usage: https://github.com/inconshreveable/ngrok.
